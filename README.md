## Introduction

<p>
This is a Personalized Learning Platform designed to enhance the learning experience for both teachers and students. The platform utilizes cutting-edge technologies to deliver tailored educational content based on teacher-provided notes. Teachers can manage subjects and notes, while students gain access to personalized learning materials including notes, flashcards, and quizzes. Additionally, an AI tutor in the form of a RAG-based chatbot assists students in their learning journey. The platform's dashboard draws inspiration from Google Classroom to provide an intuitive user experience.
